# My beautiful actor

Contains a documentation what your actor does and how to use it,
which is then displayed in the app or library. It's always a good
idea to write a good README.md, in a few months not even you
will remember all the details about the actor.

You can use [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)
language for rich formatting.
